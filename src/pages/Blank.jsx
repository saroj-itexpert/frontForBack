                    Algebra was really hard for me, and I was falling behind.
                    But my tutor goes over everything slowly and doesn't make me
                    feel dumb for asking questions. Now I actually understand
                    what's going on in class, and my grades are getting better
                    too.

                    As someone who hasn't enjoyed maths before, James made it
                    feel much easier and helped me make sense of what I am
                    learning in class. Thanks James.

                    I needed help with maths because I don't like my teachers
                    but I didn't want to fail my final year exams. James really
                    knew how to explain things in a way that I could understand
                    and I ended up doing better than expected :D

                    I wanted to find a tutor who could help advance my daughters
                    mathematics ability beyond her current age level and
                    stimulate her with more challenging material. James did an
                    excellent job of helping Olivia to build her enthusiam and
                    ability in Maths.

                    I felt that school was starting to get more challenging and
                    I was unable to pass all my exams without some extra
                    assistance. My sessions with Bridget were very supportive
                    and enjoyable and it helped make completing all my homework
                    and studying super easy.
